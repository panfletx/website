I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Yale University,
where I expect to complete my degree in 2027. My research focuses on queer and
decolonial aesthetics in contemporary Latin American and Latinx literature, with
particular attention to Mexican poetry and prose fiction.

Before Yale, I completed an MPhil in European, Latin American, and Comparative
Literatures and Cultures at the University of Cambridge (2021) and a BA in
Comparative Literature at Brown University (2020).

I am also a poet. My collection *La bestia que habito* was published by Herring
Publishers in 2022.

**Research interests:** Queer theory · Decolonial studies · Mexican literature ·
Latinx literature · Translation · Poetry
