Alan Mendoza Sosa studies contemporary Spanish-language literature written, published, and distributed in the United States from the 19th century to the present. He approaches this topic from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes migration and globalization studies, Latin American literary history, digital humanities, cultural sociology, Latinx studies, decolonial critique, and theories of the global hispanophone. His dissertation project compares Latinx literature in English and Spanish-language literature from the U.S. to reflect on how these traditions map out, expose, and critique the legacies of Spanish colonialism in contemporary everyday life. He also writes poetry and has published in several literary magazines in Mexico, Argentina, and the United States.
